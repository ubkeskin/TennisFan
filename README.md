On this project I have been studying on Firebase and Firestore libraries. Additionally, expanding/collapsing collection view cells are implemented on tabs. Furthermore, I have been working on rxswift technology to implement reactive programing for some button actions. It is worth mentioning that Alamofire, Kingfisher and DispatchGroups are used for concurrent network operations.
Since the project is still on development, screenshots cannot be shared at the moment.
